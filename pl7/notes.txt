initial solution
- best goes down (no elitism, because pop is too small)
- increasing generation does not help because best get lost

increased population
- improved fitness

increased mutation prob
- in average maybe bit better but too few experiments

increased crossover prob
- maybe bit better

decreased crossover prob
- maybe bit worse
