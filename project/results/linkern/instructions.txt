These results are valid for an algorithm which uses pre-calculated tsp tours using the Lin-Kernighan heuristic. Afterwards the simple Heuristic for the packing plan is used to obtain a packing plan.
This algorithm is not an evolutionary algorithm, but used for comparison of our approach to other approaches.
The results are given for the instances with 280 cities.

To obtain the results, set "use_linkern" in the "config_perm.json" to true and run "python batch_run.py" after checking that this script uses the correct config.
